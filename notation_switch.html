                    Learning math is hard, especially when the book or reference you are using employs a different notation than what you are used to. 
                    To both avoid confusion and learn a multiplicity of notations, one should have the ability to switch between notations on the fly while reading mathematical texts. 
                  A digital interface for reading texts that includes this feature makes learning easier and improves the usability of mathematical materials.

                    As a proof of concept, I have prototyped such an interface using Figma. 
                  The text used is an excerpt from the second edition of Stephen Wiggins' Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos. 
                  Below are two demos illustrating the prototype in action:
