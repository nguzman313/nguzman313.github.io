                <p>
                    Learning math is hard, especially when the book or reference you are using employs a different notation than what you are used to. 
                    To both avoid confusion and learn a multiplicity of notations, one should have the ability to switch between notations on the fly while reading mathematical texts. 
                    A digital interface for reading texts that includes this feature makes learning easier and improves the usability of mathematical materials.

                <p>
                    As a proof of concept, I have prototyped such an interface using Figma. 
                    The text used is an excerpt from the second edition of Stephen Wiggins' <i>Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos</i>.

                    Below are two demos illustrating the prototype in action:
