                <p>
                    As part of my graduate research in the <a href="https://www.deanmobbslab.com/" target="_blank">Fear Lab</a> at the California Institute of Technology, I developed 
                    a browser-based application for running human decision-making experiments remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                </p>
                <h3 id="problem">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The browser application administered a set of surveys and a video game task to assess the impact of social influences and
                        emotions on risky decision-making. The video game environment needed to maintain ecological validity while still delivering the user an
                        experience sufficiently engaging for them to perform the task for up to an hour. The interface needed to be accessible and intuitive for
                        users across many demographics, with an information architecture providing users with clear task instructions.
                        These studies aid in understanding decision-making processes during cooperation and conflict, knowledge which can enable 
                        the design of resilient social systems and organizations.

                        I was the sole investigator, software developer, and designer on this project.

                            <li>Complete one instance of the metacognition task.</li>

                    <p>
                        Using domain-specific knowledge from behavioral ecology and the neuroscience of decision-making, I constructed
                        statistical models of user behavior to assess the ecological validity of the video-game task.
