                <p>
                    As part of my graduate research in the <a href="https://www.deanmobbslab.com/" target="_blank">Fear Lab</a> at the California Institute of Technology, I developed 
                    a browser-based application for running human decision-making experiments remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h3 id="problem">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The browser application needed to administer a set of surveys and a video game task to assess the impact of social influences
                        on risky decision-making. The video game environment ("virtual ecology") needed to.
                        These studies aid in understanding decision-making processes during cooperation and conflict, knowledge which can enable 
                        the design of resilient social systems and organizations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was the sole investigator, software developer, and designer on this project.
